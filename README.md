<h1>Warp Shrines</h1>
Datapack for Minecraft 1.16.2+! Adds craftable, buildable Warp Shrines to the game, allowing the player to set up a vanilla, survival-friendly teleportation network.<br>

- Adds Warp Shrines to the game, make two and link them up to teleport between them.
- Balanced for late-game Minecraft worlds, difficult to craft so as to not make them OP.
- New crafting recipes for special shrine creation and linking items.
- Warp-Twisted creatures try to stop you from interfering with their domain.
- Fun effects upon shrine creation and linking!
- Works between Dimensions as well!
- Delete shrines by setting the block underneath them on fire!
- Find special shrine creation items as treasure in End Cities and as a rare drop from Endermen.
- Get a Warp Stone back when you delete a shrine.

<p align="center">Toss the <b>Warp Stone</b> ontop of a <b>Beacon</b> to create a Warp Shrine. Then, toss a <b>Link Pearl</b> ontop of the Warp Shrine to link it with the next shrine you create. You will need two shrines to be able to link them.</p>
